power_en,std_msgs.Bool,In,Enable actuator power (motor and lifter). This is a watchdog reset that starts a 50ms hardware countdown and power will be cut without repeated true messages received. This must be sent by the control server only when the big red button is enabled.
motor_en,std_msgs.Bool,In,Enable motor control. \\ Power must also be enabled for the motors to run.
cmd_vel,geometry_msgs.Twist,In,Set velocity and angular velocity of motor drive.
lifter,td_msgs.Bool,In,The value True causes the lifter to move to a raised position. \\ The value false causes the lifter to be moved to a lowered position. \\ A message received while lifter is in motion will change motion if new goal is different
